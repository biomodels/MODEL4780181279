# Model Notes
This model of sGC is based on the paper by [Kuroda S. et al. J Neurosci.
(2001) 21(15):5693-702](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retr
ieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11466441") . This models features the
activation of sGC by NO, synthesis of cGMP, activity of PKG and PP2A in the
synapse. The rates and concentrations have been taken from literature. It
contains only the part described in figure 1B of the article.
